            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My main goal professionally is to graduate with a degree in either Computer Science or Computer Information Systems and earn a job working in IT. 
            I have already begun this path by working an internship over the last summer, so if I can continue to work hard in that internship in the IT field, it is very likely I can achieve this goal, but only if I put in the work necessary for the payoff.
